# Racko-Game
This is an old card game called Racko. The player and the computer are each dealt 10 cards one through sixty, with the option to draw a new random card or from the discard pile. The goal of the game is to get your “Rack” in numerical order (least to greatest) before the computer. This program uses Tkinter for its graphical interface.
